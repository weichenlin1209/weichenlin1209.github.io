*Sophomore year has been so fulfilling — if I don’t write it down now... I’ll definitely forget how awesome it was.*

## South Orientation
The department holds orientation events before freshmen arrive — one each for the north, central, and south regions. Participation this year wasn’t great (~~maybe because calling people makes them think it’s a scam~~). Because we were short-staffed, the person in charge kept persuading me over dinner the night before. I also really wanted to surprise two people I hadn’t seen in a long time, so after hesitating I bought the ticket at the last minute and made a day trip to Tainan. To avoid being noticed, I hid in Shin Kong Mitsukoshi until the meeting time. The plan worked — they screamed: ***“What are you doing here!!!”*** Worth the transport money. In the end we only took this station photo as a memento.

## Food, food, food  
I didn’t do much before classes started — I just ate a lot of good food every day.

### [**Yongxin Desserts**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E6%B0%B8%E5%BF%83%E7%94%9C%E5%93%81/@24.1302728,120.6839958,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x34693de82039eabb:0xd208938ef7905255!8m2!3d24.1302728!4d120.6839958!16s%2Fg%2F11x92d83nr?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDkxNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)  
This place is in Zhongxiao Road Night Market, near Taichung Road — a bit of a walk from the dorm. But if you’re having dinner nearby and want dessert afterward, it’s on the way. Their ice cream is tasty and affordable, but leave room in your stomach or you’ll be too full.

### [**Wool — Pancakes**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/wool%E9%AC%86%E9%A4%85/@24.1245556,120.6731083,18z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1z6ayG6aSF!3m6!1s0x34693d0b701e9131:0xe1ce1b0d3fe1ea7c!8m2!3d24.1245556!4d120.6742026!15sCgbprIbppIVaCSIH6ayGIOmkhZIBCnJlc3RhdXJhbnSaAURDaTlEUVVsUlFVTnZaRU5vZEhsalJqbHZUMjFrYmxOc1RraFdWazU1WVRKU2FsVnNaRTVOVmpnd1dsVk9kbUZHUlJBQqoBRwoJL20vMDFkd3N6EAEqCyIH6ayGIOmkhShFMh4QASIaKvMbKb9B0V30roAokRhIJjGdXiOj2243clsyCxACIgfprIYg6aSF4AEA-gEECAAQJA!16s%2Fg%2F11m5_hc7p8?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDkxNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)  
This one is across from Xingda Road — (~~discovering it felt like finding a new continent~~). I ordered the Margherita-style one with cheese on top of the pancake. I’m not great at writing food reviews, so I’ll stop before I make it awkward — I just want to share tasty photos. Anyway, everything was delicious (✪ω✪).

### [**Kojirō Curry**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E5%B0%8F%E6%AC%A1%E7%94%B7%E5%92%96%E5%93%A9%E6%89%80-%E5%AF%A9%E8%A8%88%E5%BA%97/@24.1452211,120.6616097,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x34693d3b8835da69:0x85ebbe6774d00219!8m2!3d24.1452211!4d120.6616097!16s%2Fg%2F11sg7_xrdr?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDkxNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)  
The location I visited is in the Audit Village; there’s a branch in Taichung Park too. This is the best curry I’ve ever had. It’s a little pricey, but very tasty.

### [**Kalihundan — Curry Soul Egg**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E5%92%96%E5%93%A9%E9%AD%82%E8%9B%8BKalihundan-%E8%88%88%E5%A4%A7%E5%BA%97/@24.1247562,120.6735437,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x34693da0a1bdb9bf:0xd03b59e0e41398a8!8m2!3d24.1247562!4d120.6735437!16s%2Fg%2F11h22jdmw5?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDkxNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)  
Tucked in an alley off Xingda Road — **all-you-can-add rice!** It turns into a bar at night, but I haven’t been yet even though I’m a sophomore.

First time at a dessert specialty shop — achievement unlocked! It was delicious and very photogenic, but my wallet felt it.

## Camping crew
No comment for now, or I’ll spoil things. But actually I already wrote it and commented it out. Think you can see it in the repo? Nope — I locked it up~ To be serious: camping involves 12 hours of food service per week, half of which is at night — you get almost no sleep and it’s exhausting.  
*Seriously, don’t be fooled into becoming a crew worker.*

## Guitar Club
The Guitar Club is busy preparing for orientation: checking songs, setting up the canopy — so busy but having fun. Although people aren’t that close yet, they’re easy to chat with. Big shout-out to our design partner — super talented. No more talk, let’s get the canopy up!

***Come watch my solo!***

## Magical research  
### LaTeX  
Playtime aside, I’ve been doing actual work — I learned [LaTeX](https://class.kh.edu.tw/19061/bulletin/msg_view/592) these days and digitized my notes, uploading them to AFFINE. Now I can read them anywhere and they look nicer. Classes aren’t that heavy yet (~~probably because I only have 18 credits so it doesn’t feel like much~~).

![LaTeX](/images/2025/9/diary-25-09-19/LaTeX.webp)  

### [Course-snatching hooligans](/post/coursegangster-1/)  
There’s no plan for a part 2 yet because of cookie issues — the school’s cookie is http-only, so we might resort to manually copying via F12. Also, I heard the school has a public API for course numbers, so that shouldn’t be a big problem. I’ll test it next semester and then post about it.

### Flipper Zero NFC
Lately I haven’t been carrying my student ID when going out (~~I just use my Flipper to open doors~~). I’m mapping the campus access points — some doors only check card IDs, some have weird settings like “AC POWER FAILURE.” I’ll publish a map post later. The goal is to eventually open doors without copying cards; once it’s ready I’ll open-source it. There’s very little info online, so anyone interested is welcome to join.
