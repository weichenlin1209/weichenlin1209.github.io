> This semester has finally come to an end, so I can share what courses I took this semester. Which courses are so good that they’re worth taking again, and which ones you should avoid—consider this an information sharing post. This share is not limited to courses from this semester, since I didn’t know how to write a blog before.

<!--more-->
The following are purely personal opinions. Please do not choose courses based solely on my evaluations. Something that is easy for me may not be easy for you, and something that is hard for me may not actually be that hard. So please consult multiple sources of opinions and choose courses based on your own interests.

## Required Courses

### Calculus — Deng Jun-Hao
The instructor teaches very seriously, and I’ve also heard that he teaches well. Why “heard”? ~~Because I never went to class~~. The professor once said: “I won’t fail you just because you don’t come to class.” Basically, as long as you pass the exams, you’re fine. However, starting this semester the course is taught entirely in English, so I’m not sure whether the difficulty has changed. Personally, I don’t think it’s very difficult, but there is a lot of homework—around 200 problems per midterm—and most of it is dirty work. Students from other departments are not recommended to take it, since you’ll have no time to do the homework. As for underclassmen in the department… there’s no escaping it. If you want an easier time, study it during winter or summer break—finish earlier, relax earlier (that’s how I did it). That said, you’ll see many seniors retaking Calculus (II). The reason is unknown—maybe it’s a **course so good it’s worth taking again**.

### Linear Algebra — Hsieh Po-Wen
This course is **hard! Super hard!** The lectures are basically all proofs—not the kind of linear algebra where you just do matrix operations and compute eigenvalues. If time permits, every theorem will be proven for you, so you’ll understand where all these abstract concepts come from, ~~and also learn how to divine answers~~. You must take notes in class. First, because you might have nothing to review at home—since the instructor doesn’t strictly follow the textbook, and you probably won’t want to read the textbook anyway. Second, you have to submit your notes at the end of the semester. If you unfortunately fail, having submitted your notes might mean ~~he treats you to Haidilao~~—no, he’ll pull you out of the depths. It’s said that he even rescues people who originally averaged only 30–40 points! Don’t be afraid to keep taking it if you fail; he might save you. But if you care a lot about GPA, that’s another story.

### Data Structures — Kuo Chih-En
Very chill! Easy to get points. If you attend class seriously, you can also learn something—provided that you **have absolutely no prior background**. If you’ve already learned some data structures and still want to learn more, I’d recommend taking Data Structures in the CS department instead. But if you’re from this department, you’ll need to ask the department office whether it can be used for credit transfer. This course has four exams in total: two quizzes (20% each), a midterm (25%), and a final (25%). It’s basically like taking four midterms. However, the exam papers look almost identical to past exams. As long as you memorize all the answers before the exam, it’s quite easy to get a high score.

> Want my past exams? If you want them, I can give you everything—go find them! I’ve put all the past exams there!

### Programming — Peng Guan-Ju, Tu Jing-Ting
One of the chillest courses out there. Plus, I already knew the material, so it was extra chill. The first half of the semester was taught by Peng Guan-Ju, who just played videos in class. Attending class was the same as watching at home—actually worse, because if class ended halfway through a video, it would be interrupted. Watching on your own doesn’t have this issue, so I’d suggest not going. The second half was taught by Tu Jing-Ting, who taught herself and in a different style. Attendance was taken during class. When I took this course last year, there were assignments and exams. This year, I heard there are no assignments, but there are weekly quizzes. The situation seems different every year, so this information might not be very useful—it keeps changing.

### Operating Systems — Yen Tseng-Chang
He uses his own lecture notes with blanks, so you need to listen carefully in class (at least fill in the blanks). He’s one of the more serious lecturers in the department. As long as you listen attentively, you’ll understand. However, after seeing the Dinosaur Book, I feel that his teaching is quite shallow—many parts are cut out. He only covers what he considers truly important. There are three exams in a semester, and he says they’re optional. If the first two add up to 180 points, you don’t need to take the final. As for remediation if you barely fail—submit your notes! I heard that submitting notes can add up to 10 points to your final score. If you want to preview my notes, I’ve put them in the [notes section](https://study.windson.cc/docs/OS/intro).

### Computer Organization — Li Pei-Ju
This is the most stifling class I’ve ever taken—physically stifling. I don’t know why, but every time I attended this class, it felt stuffy, as if the air was filled with carbon dioxide, making it impossible to think clearly. Combined with the instructor’s voice, it made people fall asleep instantly. So if you actually want to learn, self-study is more efficient. I recommend the open courseware from NTHU, which explains things very clearly. However, NTHU uses MIPS, while this course uses RISC-V, so you’ll need to relearn the assembly part yourself. The midterm and final exams are both not easy. The hardest part so far is acting as a “human compiler.” The average score seems to be around 30–40, so be prepared if you take it.

### Freshman Chinese — Chen Chang-Yuan
Amazing teacher, highly recommended for life! His classes feel like chatting—though it’s mostly him talking—but if you listen carefully, you’ll learn a lot, on the level of life philosophies, and also how ancient people thought. His course only has a final report, a self-introduction nine-grid, and the required reading reflection set by the school. Sometimes you watch *Farewell My Concubine*. Highly recommended. And he gives high grades.

Although it might not sound great to say this, as long as you participate in group work and presentations, your grade won’t be bad. Pick it quickly!!!!!

### Freshman English — Lin Chien-Kuang
There is a quiz every class, with 10 questions each time. You can usually find the answers in the textbook. About every two units, you need to submit a video, with content varying by topic. This course is not easy, but you can feel that the instructor tries to make it less boring. He and the TAs organize activities and discussions, though these don’t count toward your grade. His grading scheme is public, and only the final report counts toward your grade. My grade in this course wasn’t high—not because my English is bad, but because I didn’t buy the textbook. His exams are almost entirely based on the textbook, both quizzes and major exams. The final exam’s reading section doesn’t even provide the passage, which I personally think is a terrible design, because I couldn’t get any points. If you want a high score, just memorize the textbook thoroughly. As for how I passed without the textbook? I might have used divination—after divining, the answers appeared.

## General Education

### Introduction to Piano Performance
The prerequisite for taking this course is that you must already know how to play the piano—even just a little bit (by “a little,” I mean roughly Kawai Piano Grade 13, not just playing *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star* with one finger). You can’t learn it solely from class time. This course has two students sharing one electronic piano. The midterm is playing individually for the instructor. The final is like a recital, where you go on stage to perform. Those who already know how to play can choose their own pieces; beginners have a limited selection. If possible, choose the 3rd or 4th periods, so you don’t have to help move the pianos. After class, you can also stay and practice if you want. As for grades—they’re definitely high, otherwise I wouldn’t be recommending it here, right?

## Other Departments

### Introduction to Information Security
This course is required for MIS and CS students. It mostly focuses on defensive aspects of information security; attacks are only taught a little in TA sessions. If you want to be a hacker, this course doesn’t seem very useful. Everything is theoretical; if you want hands-on practice, you have to do it yourself at home—after all, there are over 100 students in the class. Exams are all short-answer questions. Although you can find everything in the slides, memorizing all of it is still tiring. Unless you can get past exams, I wouldn’t recommend taking this course.
