This performance was hilarious — someone just wouldn’t play the guitar properly. They mixed [“May the World Be Gentle with You”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boETEUNxZJY) with [“My Passionate Kiss”](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/T0M6coupdGc), which made the vocalist burst out laughing. The whole thing was absurd. Anyway, **I** played normally.

I’m really starting to love the Guitar Club — we always have such a good time together. There weren’t many people in the audience these two days, so there was no reason to be nervous. It’s my first time on stage feeling this chill; I hope it stays that way! Here are the two songs we played this time

## What Does Love Look Like
This one was the vocalist’s pick. The arrangement was supposed to be redone,  
~~but we were too lazy, so we just strummed all the way through.~~

## Planet
A friend got me into this song, and I’ve loved it ever since. I started practicing it during summer break, so I’ve pretty much memorized the chords. It was just for fun at first — I never thought we’d actually perform it. We did, though, and the vocalist said it’s exhausting every time. Next time I’ll try playing it faster.
