*Hello World!!*
<!--more-->
[This site](https://windson.cc/) was successfully created today, built with **Hugo** and **PaperMod**.  
Special thanks to my [junior](https://iach.cc) who helped me configure everything — without his help, this website probably would’ve taken another week to finish.  

Although the site is now up and running, I still have a long way to go before I’m fully familiar with how it works.
