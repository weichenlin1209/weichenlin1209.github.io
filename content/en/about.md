## About Me

I’m Whisky — that’s my name in every game I play. It came from my elementary school friend mispronouncing my English name *Windson* as *Whiskey*. I’m currently a sophomore majoring in Applied Mathematics, though honestly, I don’t really feel like one — ~~I spend way more time in the world of computer science than doing math.~~

### What I’m Currently Up To  
- Flipper Zero NFC ~~I’m totally not trying to open every door on campus~~  
- Home Lab  
- Reverse Engineering  
- Guitar

After connecting with many people in the tech field (mostly through blogs), I realized that most platforms don’t treat users very well. Some use user data to train their models, others force you to accept questionable terms just to use their services. That’s why I don’t like using Instagram, Facebook, or Line.  

If you want to understand what these platforms do with your data, you can check their terms of service yourself — if you’re so lazy to do that, visit [ToS;DR](https://tosdr.org/)

### Student Association
I’m the IT manager of my department’s student association. Well, “IT manager” — but in practice, I mostly act as PR, managing social accounts and announcements. Recently, I got the domain for the association from the head, so I’m planning to set up a website, exam archive system, RSS server, and official email. Hopefully, I’ll finish all that next semester.

### Guitar Club　　
I’m currently a teaching assistant in the Guitar Club. If I don’t have anything else going on, I attend every class — I still learn new things from them, especially since I never learned guitar through formal lessons.
