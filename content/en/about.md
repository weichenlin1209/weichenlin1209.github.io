## About Me

I’m Whisky — that’s my name in every game I play. It came from my elementary school friend mispronouncing my English name *Windson* as *Whiskey*. I’m currently a sophomore majoring in Applied Mathematics, though honestly, I don’t really feel like one — ~~I spend way more time in the world of computer science than doing math.~~

### What I’m Currently Up To  
- Flipper Zero NFC ~~I’m totally not trying to open every door on campus~~  
- Home Lab  
- Reverse Engineering  
- Guitar 

### Contact Me  
As long as your message doesn’t end up in spam and doesn’t look like a scam, I’ll probably reply.

> Why no Line or Instagram?

- #### Stop using Line
    Line is a **closed-source commercial app** with extremely unreasonable [terms of service](https://wiwi.blog/blog/line-privacy-policy/). If you haven’t read them before, check out the link above — Wiwi goes through everything in detail.  
    Also, it completely fails as a communication tool:

    - **Too many ads and spam messages**  
      I often have to dig through piles of spam just to find real messages from friends or classmates. 
      That’s a terrible experience for a messaging app, but since I live in Taiwan, I have no choice but to use it.

    - **Closed data**  
      All chat data is stored locally, yet files still expire — which makes no sense at all.

    - **Poor support**  
      Line doesn’t support Linux users, and it’s about to remove its Chrome extension too. That means I won’t be able to use Line on my computer anymore.  

- #### Don’t use Instagram either  
    Instagram uses your posts, messages, and browsing data to train its models. I just want to see what my friends are up to — but instead, the algorithm feeds me targeted ads nonstop.  

    Also, Instagram content is locked behind accounts. *If I don’t have an account, I can’t see anything.* So ,don’t put your creations there — they become invisible to the web.  

    And then there’s the **reel** (or **short**). The algorithm shows you an endless stream of short videos that perfectly match your interests. Once you get hooked, you enter a “time chamber” — suddenly two or three hours are gone, and you’ve done nothing.  It’s literally draining your time for money.

### Student Association
I’m the IT manager of my department’s student association. Well, “IT manager” — but in practice, I mostly act as PR, managing social accounts and announcements. Recently, I got the domain for the association from the head, so I’m planning to set up a website, exam archive system, RSS server, and official email. Hopefully, I’ll finish all that next semester.  

There’s also a department barbecue coming up. Even though the sign-up is closed, if you’re reading this… I might let you sneak in.

### Guitar Club　　
I’m currently a teaching assistant in the Guitar Club. If I don’t have anything else going on, I attend every class — I still learn new things from them, especially since I never learned guitar through formal lessons.
