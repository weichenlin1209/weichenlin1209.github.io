## About Me

My nickname is **Whisky**. I use this name in almost all games. It comes from a nickname given by one of my elementary school classmates, who pronounced my English name *Windson* as *Whisky*.

I am currently a second-year student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at National Chung Hsing University. However, I don’t really like doing math, and I’m not even good at calculating. Recently, I’ve been learning CTFs and deploying cloud services.

> Why don’t I use Line or Instagram?
  
- #### Stop using Line
    Line has extremely unreasonable [Terms of Service](https://wiwi.blog/blog/line-privacy-policy/). If you haven’t read them before, please click the link I provided—Wiwi walks you through everything step by step. Also, it fails to do what a messaging app is supposed to do:

    - **Way too many ads and spam messages**  
      I often have to dig through piles of spam just to find messages from friends or people trying to contact me. As a messaging app, this experience is terrible. But since I live in Taiwan, I’m almost forced to use it.  
  
    - **Closed data**  
      All data is stored locally on your device, yet files expire. This design makes no sense.  

    - **Poor platform support**  
      It doesn’t support Linux users, and recently it even plans to remove the Chrome extension. This means that unless I install `wine`, I can’t use Line on my computer at all.  

- #### Stop using Instagram  
    Instagram takes your creations, posts, messages, and browsing history, and uses all of them to train models. I just want to see what my friends are doing today, but instead, the algorithm precisely feeds me ads it thinks I might like. That again forces me to look for my friends among piles of ads.
    
    Moreover, information on Instagram is extremely closed. If I don’t have an account, I can’t see anything at all. Don’t put information on Instagram—it’s impossible to search or find.  

    And then there’s something even more insidious called `reels`, or what you might call `shorts`. Through algorithms, it precisely shows you short videos you’re interested in. Once you’re addicted, you enter a kind of mental time capsule—when you snap out of it, two or three hours are gone and nothing has been done. It literally sucks up your time and turns it into money!

But I haven’t been idle—I keep opening new side quests for myself. I’ll share a course-related write-up at the end of the semester.

#### Guitar Club　　
I am currently a **teaching staff member** in the guitar club, so you’ll basically see me in every club session. I also learn a lot during these sessions, since I never learned guitar through formal lessons. I’m taking on the role of general coordinator for next semester’s spring showcase. If you have any interesting ideas for the performance title, feel free to email me.
